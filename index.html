                <p>From the moment we started dating, adopting a child has always been our dream.</p>

                <h2>What Our Life is Like</h2>
                <p>Life with us is full of energy and affection, with creativity woven into everything we do. We both
                    have big "art hearts", so we love spending time on house projects, playing music, and writing. We
                    can't wait to nurture a child's creative spirit and watch their imagination take off.</p>
                <p>Beyond our passion for art, we are an active couple who loves the outdoors. We hike, bike, camp, and
                    stay fit at the gym. We're excited to share our love for nature and fitness.</p>
                <p>Travel is another passion we plan to share with a future child. We believe in exposing a child to the
                    world's beauty and diversity.</p>
                <p>We want to create a home where a child feels safe, supported, and celebrated for their unique self.
                    As a gay couple, we've learned the importance of feeling like you belong.</p>

                <h2>About Luke</h2>
                <h4 class="subtitle">(as written by Shane)</h4>
                <p>Luke is one of the most talented people I've ever known. From writing and filming to photography, his
                    talents seem limitless. As a husband, he provides me with unconditional love and stability. He is
                    incredibly supportive and I see it as one of his superpowers.</p>
                <p>When I watch him play with our nieces and nephews, his joy and warmth totally shines through. It's
                    easy to imagine what a great father he'll be. He's goofy, laughs hard and always spins us off on
                    exciting new adventures.</p>
                <p>Luke is a great leader. He has an incredible knack for motivating me and the people who work for him
                    to do their best work. He's constantly reading, studying, and developing himself.</p>

                <h4 class="subtitle">(as written by Luke)</h4>
                <p>Being married to him is one of the greatest joys in my life. He has a sharp sense of humor and always
                    makes me laugh.</p>
                <p>One of my favorite things about Shane is his cooking. He makes these incredible meals, often
                    incorporating his Korean and Chinese heritage to make them extra special.</p>
                <p>He's also brilliant. He speaks 3 languages and has a thriving career as an architect.</p>
                <p>I think what I love most about Shane is his boldness and bravery. When he sets his mind to something,
                    he goes after it with full commitment and determination.</p>
                <p>It's really amazing!</p>

                    become and the life they'll have. At the end of the day, we're offering them a life full of love and
                    care. We promise to give them a strong sense of belonging and make sure they always feel safe and
                    supported.</p>

                    identity and background. Our home is filled with kindness, empathy, and acceptance, and we'll raise
                    your child with these same values. They'll always know their story, the deep love and strength
                    behind your decision, and how grateful we are to be their parents.</p>
