                <h1>Looking to Adopt in Portland, OR</h1>
                <p>We’re Luke and Shane, a couple from Portland, OR.</p>
                <p>From the moment we started dating, adopting a child has always been our dream.</p>
                <p>Our goal is to create a nurturing environment where a child feels safe, cherished, and free to
                    explore their own unique path. Trusting us with this precious gift would complete our family and
                    allow us to share a lifetime of love and support.</p>

                <div class="facts-grid">
                    <p>😍 We met in L.A. in 2014. It was love at first sight and have been together ever since.</p>
                    <p>🚙 We drive a Jeep Wrangler, which we love to take on road trips.</p>
                    <p>🧑‍💻 We both work from home and always try to eat lunch together.</p>
                    <p>🎨 Our favorite artist is Vincent Van Gogh. His paintings are so vivid and full of color.</p>
                    <p>🥾 Our first date was hiking around the Hollywood Sign.</p>
                    <p>🐟 We hope to buy a cabin by a lake one day. We think it would be amazing!</p>

                <h2>What Our Life is Like</h2>
                <p>Life with us is full of energy and affection, with creativity woven into everything we do. We both
                    have big “art hearts”, so we love spending time on house projects, playing music, and writing. We
                    can’t wait to nurture a child’s creative spirit and watch their imagination take off.</p>
                <p>Beyond our passion for art, we are an active couple who loves the outdoors. We hike, bike, camp, and
                    stay fit at the gym. We’re excited to share our love for nature and fitness.</p>
                <p>Travel is another passion we plan to share with a future child. We believe in exposing a child to the
                    world’s beauty and diversity.</p>
                <p>We want to create a home where a child feels safe, supported, and celebrated for their unique self.
                    As a gay couple, we’ve learned the importance of feeling like you belong.</p>

                <h2>About Luke (as written by Shane)</h2>
                <p>Luke is one of the most talented people I’ve ever known. From writing and filming to photography, his
                    talents seem limitless. As a husband, he provides me with unconditional love and stability. He is
                    incredibly supportive and I see it as one of his superpowers.</p>
                <p>When I watch him play with our nieces and nephews, his joy and warmth totally shines through. It’s
                    easy to imagine what a great father he’ll be. He’s goofy, laughs hard and always spins us off on
                    exciting new adventures.</p>
                <p>Luke is a great leader. He has an incredible knack for motivating me and the people who work for him
                    to do their best work. He’s constantly reading, studying, and developing himself.</p>

                <h2>About Shane (as written by Luke)</h2>
                <p>Being married to him is one of the greatest joys in my life. He has a sharp sense of humor and always
                    makes me laugh.</p>
                <p>One of my favorite things about Shane is his cooking. He makes these incredible meals, often
                    incorporating his Korean and Chinese heritage to make them extra special.</p>
                <p>He’s also brilliant. He speaks 3 languages and has a thriving career as an architect.</p>
                <p>I think what I love most about Shane is his boldness and bravery. When he sets his mind to something,
                    he goes after it with full commitment and determination.</p>
                <p>It’s really amazing!</p>

                <p>We know this is a big decision. Where your child grows up shapes who they become and the life they’ll
                    have. At the end of the day, we’re offering them a life full of love and care. We promise to give
                    them a strong sense of belonging and make sure they always feel safe and supported.</p>
                <p>We’ll be there to nurture their talents and make sure they have everything they need to grow into the
                    best version of themselves. Every day, we’ll honor your child’s unique identity and background. Our
                    home is filled with kindness, empathy, and acceptance, and we’ll raise your child with these same
                    values. They’ll always know their story, the deep love and strength behind your decision, and how
                    grateful we are to be their parents.</p>
                <p>Thank you for considering us. We want this journey to feel comfortable for you, and we’re here to
                    support you every step of the way. We can’t wait to get to know you better and hear more about what
                    the future looks like for you, your child, and all of us together.</p>
